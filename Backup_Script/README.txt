The backup script file is intended to automatically run the backup and restore 
of the database through command line on the CSE server. The script will prompt 
the user twice for a password and the intended input should be: ":m3CMg" 
(without the quotation marks). After entering this password twice, the database
should be restored with the most recent backup.
